## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Practiced the use of Flexbox and semantic HTML. Used the "main" and "footer" HTML elements.
Also practiced using git commands to push from local environment to github.

```html
<main>Inserted the QR component here</main>
<footer>Inserted attribution here</footer>
```
```css
.QR-card-parent{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
}
```



### Continued development

I need to keep practicing the use of git commands. I still get confused with some commands.

### Useful resources

- [Video for deploying to Github pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGcuxuhV-Jg&t=453s) - This helped me in deploying from the local environment to Github pages.
